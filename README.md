## üìñ Project Description

This project is currently in an **early development phase**.  
The goal is to build a comprehensive framework for understanding the dynamics of financial markets by analyzing:  

1. **Major Assets Analysis**  
   - Study of Bitcoin, equities, bonds, and commodities.  
   - Historical exploration to uncover trends, correlations, and risk dynamics.  

2. **Liquidity and Debt Cycles**  
   - In-depth analysis of U.S. liquidity cycles.  
   - Exploration of public debt dynamics and their macroeconomic implications.  
   - Examination of how these cycles affect financial assets.  

The project leverages **time series analysis, econometrics, and machine learning** to build predictive models and extract robust insights for both asset behavior and macroeconomic conditions.
